# This repository showcases the work that I did for a class assignment that asked me to create a machine learning model for a hotel that predicts whether a reservation will be cancelled. I apply feature normalization, feature scaling, and feature selection on the initial data set and train 2 models to acheive this task: Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree.
